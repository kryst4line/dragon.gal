It's a recurring joke that if you're a Ferrari fan, you're up for disappointment. They're the most renowned team ever in F1, and yet a mix of higher-ups' egos, bureaucracy and pride make them a bunch of clowns that [will always fail to win the championship in one way or another](https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/kryst4line/its-official-finally-2025-is-ferraris-year-v0-peoxoazw118x3sowuandl4kkvoans7p0qw6s_8hgis01.webp).

Being a classic Metroid fan is like being a Ferrari fan. All that made me fall in love with the series —the sense of isolation, surrounding atmosphere and unique gameplay— **has been progressively taken out from its games** and you constantly feel like they'll always find how to screw it all up.

Last week there was a small preview since in two weeks we'll have a new release: The first prime Prime *(hehe)* title since 2007's Metroid Prime 3. It was a disappointment for me back then because it took out all things the series was known for, trying to be more of a generic Halo-like shooter with total linearity and constant incoming messages to **avoid at all costs that the more casual Wii player didn't get lost.** Not even talking about how it was plagued with all your usual Wiimote gimmicks from the early Wii era.

And this sequel looks like will keep that same way. After 18 years of waiting all we got were an **open-world area with a motorbike** (what in the actual fuck) and **bad written dialogs with comical relief characters** in a game that doesn't need any, because they break from that same sense of immersion and isolation, and... I don't know, **I feel like they don't even know what made the series special** and just want to call the general public's attention. And this never was the solution.

Metroid was what represented my love for the whole medium: **Something special and unique that couldn't find anywhere else.** Now... I don't know what to feel anymore. And even worse, you can't complain because current Nintendo fans don't know what critical thinking is. All they know is to praise every game and **if you don't, you're a hater.**

**I guess I can't get excited for anything, anymore.**
