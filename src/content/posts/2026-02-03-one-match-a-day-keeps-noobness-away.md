Through last year there was a few occasions where I had to wake up early to play a match and keep the streak, but in the end I could get it to 365 days. It might seem a dumb thing, but I'm sure if I watch gameplay of myself from a year ago **I will realize how much better I am now**, even when the improvement was so gradual over months.

Currently at 3500 hours played, it is **the game I've played the most in my life**; and I played quite a few. Damn, it really is a good bunch of hours. _Godspeed!_
