title: My quest to find the best Switch 2 grip/case
meta_description: Can you believe there are tons of Switch 2 grips and cases but none with all the things I'm looking for? Yeah, me neither.

Ever since I got the Switch 2 around 2 months ago I knew I was going to get a grip eventually for obvious reasons. You know, first of all **a 500€ device so slim and unprotected doesn't fit well with my idea of tranquility.** And then there's the whole "this is a freaking 7 inches tablet with slimsy magnetic controls attached to it" part, so it's neither really portable or comfortable. And well, a grip helps with both.

But then **autism kicks in** and my inner picky materializes in "I need this specific series of features because I'm a fixating bitch and will proceed to dig into the whole grip/case market for the Switch 2 and swell every bit of information, reviews and possible issues that every one of them has". **Just girly things, you wouldn't understand.**

Which are those features so important to me, you say? Alright, let's begin explaining them, at least the best that I can:

- **Looks comfortable:** A grip must be the most comfortable to use possible, if not there's no point in getting a grip... Duh. And I haven't really put my hands on any of them, but after playing with dozens of different controllers in my life I think I can see beforehand when something's a bit orthopedic. Also, I'd like it to be not too big as I pretend to keep it when I take the thing outside.

- **Build quality:** These things cost from 30€ upwards, so I don't want to spend that much money if all I'm going to get is a piece of hard plastic that will damage my console.

- **Body protection:** I'm a butterfingered bitch even though I try my best to take care of my consoles (it comes with being a collector I guess lol), so if for whatever reason my 500€ console slips from my fingers I don't want it to turn into Schrödinger's Switch: Both alive and dead at the same time until it hits the ground.

- **Removable joycons:** I usually play handheld, but every now and then I like to lay on the couch and play on the TV. I do have an 8BitDo Pro 3, but right now it's being in use by my partner with the Switch 1, so I'd like to be able to get the joycons out easily without disassembling the whole thing.

- **Usable kickstand:** More than on TV, I tend to play tabletop on my desk, so yeah, it would be a bummer if I can't use one of Switch 2's main features like the rear kickstand.

- **Dockable:** Self-explanatory, I don't want to take out everything just to be able to play on the TV, it must fit within the dock while the grip is on.

- **Compatible front plate:** This is a bit more tricky. You must know about the typical zippy case, right? The one you open the zip, put the console in and then zip it back in so it's all cozy and warm while you're not using it. So there's another kind of case, a partial one that consists on a hard plastic cover for the screen side; which along with the grip it means it's all protected anyway and way more appropriate to carry around without all that extra bulk.

- **Price:** I'm not rich, bitch.

So after more hours than I'd like to admit, I found a list of possible candidates to be *The Chosen One™️*. \

## Dbrand Killswitch

![bz8P987[1]](https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/kryst4line/bz8p9871.webp)

Even before I had the Switch 2 I knew I wanted this grip/case, it looks like an absolute unit. Maybe too much of a unit, as it seems **a bit too bulky both to take outside and fit in the dock.** It needs an adapter to connect the damn thing to the TV and to be honest it might not be their finest job. On the other hand, the **front plate accessory** it's absolutely perfect and it's a shame, because...

**WHAT THE FUCK** with the price? I made a test order for the travel package (grip + adapter and the front panel) and it went **over 100 or even 110€** after adding shipping and taxes to Spain. It was fun while it lasted, I guess.

- **Looks comfortable:** ⚠️ \
  *Seems a bit too bulky to be truly portable*
- **Build quality:** ✅
- **Body protection:** ✅
- **Removable Joycons:** ✅
- **Usable kickstand:** ✅
- **Dockable:** ⚠️ \
  *With an adapter*
- **Compatible front plate:** ✅
- **Price:** ❌ \
  *__>100€__ with shipping + taxes, what the FUCK* \

## Savage Raven StandGrip

![WU3AfSa[1]](https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/kryst4line/wu3afsa1.webp)

The alternative to another grip from Savage Raven (I keep misspelling the brand as "Savage Garden", lol) that doesn't even protects the back side of the console as an excuse to access to the kickstand.

Yesterday they announced FissionGrip, a modular grip that unfortunately it's incompatible with their own front panel for the NeoGrip case, so it's a pass too.

- **Looks comfortable:** ✅
- **Build quality:** ⚠️ \
  *It's just rubbery plastic.*
- **Body protection:** ⚠️ \
  *A bit too finicky to provide real drop protection.*
- **Removable Joycons:** ❌
- **Usable kickstand:** ❌
- **Dockable:** ❌
- **Compatible front plate:** ✅
- **Price:** ✅ \
  *33€* \
  \

## SUPCASE UB Pro

When I found this it seemed amazing, even though the grips are not really ergonomic. Sadly, a lack of usable kickstand and front panel make it a worse option that another that I will show later.

## JSAUX Split Protective Case

![WNPUpR0[1]](https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/kryst4line/wnpupr01.webp)

In **theory** it has everything: slim profile, modular design, dockable, it has a compatible front-plate... But then you take a closer look and notice how it's the cheapest thing you could have got.

- **Looks comfortable:** ✅
- **Build quality:** ❌ \
  *Fully made of cheap, hard plastic. It even scratches joycons, as reported.*
- **Body protection:** ❌ \
  *Don't make me laugh.*
- **Removable Joycons:** ✅
- **Usable kickstand:** ✅
- **Dockable:** ✅
- **Compatible front plate:** ✅
- **Price:** ✅ \
  *30€* \

## Mumba Titan

![Wl8jVpi[1]](https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/kryst4line/wl8jvpi1.webp)

Absolute Unit v2: The Revenge. This really looks like could make your Switch survive a 2 meters drop ~~as long as it hits the bottom~~ with a mix of harder plastics and soft, rubbery silicone. I'm in love with its industrial design, although it lacks the front plate, and it's a real shame. To fix this, Mumba has a companion zip case to keep the whole package as portable as possible. I guess it's good enough.

The main body keeps the original kickstand hidden, but it adds a rear plate as a replacement with the added feature of holding your games with the console. It's dockable too, but the flap needs to be opened to fit in.

Something I didn't tell it's some of these grips (mostly this and SUPCASE's) are not modular but instead have two hinges behind the joycons to open it and let them out. You don't get to keep the grip while using the joycons out but that might be a pro for some people: While using them in mouse mode, no grip at all can be better than a bad grip for this use.

- **Looks comfortable:** ✅
  *Seems a bit too bulky to be truly portable*
- **Build quality:** ⚠️ \
  *Looks good, but there are reports for the rear plate/kickstand getting loose with time.*
- **Body protection:** ✅
- **Removable Joycons:** ✅
- **Usable kickstand:** ⚠️ \
  *It has it's own rear plate to use both as kickstand and game card holder.*
- **Dockable:** ⚠️ \
  *Just remember to lift the rear plate before shoving it down.*
- **Compatible front plate:** ⚠️ \
  *So close to perfection... Though Mumba offers a specific zip case to keep it as slim as possible.*
- **Price:** ✅ \
  *33€, and another 33€ for the zip case* \
  \

## In conclusion...

...I think the **Mamba Titan might be the lesser of all the evils here**, even if none of the currently available grips check all my boxes. These are the results of a few days digging this rabbit hole, and if it helped you somehow **I'd be glad to hear about your choosing** through email!
