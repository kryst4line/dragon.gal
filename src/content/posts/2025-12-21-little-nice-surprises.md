A long-time friend of mine spent last November on Japan, and I'm not jealous. **Not at all.**

Before going, he asked me if I wanted him to look for something, and obviously the answer was Metroid games and some other soundtracks. And he did find some! What I'm looking for the most is Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission's CIB (complete in box) japanese releases because they are *precious*, but he found **Metroid Prime 1 and 2** and those are beautiful as well, so I can't complain in any way. Not only that, but he also got **Gran Turismo 5's original soundtrack**... SEALED! I'm a huge fan of one of their composers, **Daiki Kasho** (which also made a good bunch of songs for F-Zero GX), so this is a treasure for me.

But the surprise came when he appeared with a gashapon ball, which he never told me about: A goddamn **keyring of a Gamecube button pad**. I knew from this when they launched them last year, but as this is was a Nintendo Store thing that it's only on Japan, never expected to have one. I'm freaking living.

It's amazing how they got the plastic color, texture and even the button feel straight from the original controller. It even serves as original replacement parts for the actual thing! Another thing that I thought is **it could be modded to be a bluetooth controller for shortcuts**, because why the hell no; but for now it's just my unique fidget toy. I don't really know anyone else that has one, so if someone is half as nerd as me, I know it will be a great conversation starter.
