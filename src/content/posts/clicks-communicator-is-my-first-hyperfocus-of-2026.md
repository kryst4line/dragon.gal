The hyperfocus cycle has begun, yet again, and pretty soon this year. Some of you might know how obsessed I am with **PKB phones**, going as far as getting a **Blackberry Classic Q20** last year just to have some fun with it. And it is really fun! But also way too limited for a casual use nowadays. I had to bypass BBM activation, manually update TLS certificates and dig for some modified apks that worked specifically on the Android 4.4 compatibility layer and even then they are **slow as fuck** and the browser engine is so **outdated** that most webs don't show properly.

## Introducing my new obsession

Two days ago Clicks (a phone keyboard cases company co-founded by Mr. Mobile) introduced both a bluetooth MAGsafe/Qi 2 sliding keyboard and **a new PKB Android phone**. The bluetooth keyboard is cool, but the phone? **It's GORGEOUS.**

Obviously, I couldn't help but get excited about it because it looks awesome:

- BB Classic form factor
- Bigger and more usable keyboard
- **Android 16**, so full compatibility with current apps
- Colored backplate
- **Notification led** with different colors for different notification groups
- Custom version of Niagara Launcher that looks amazing
- **Affordable[^1]**

[^1]: **The price is $400 (380€ with shipping and taxes)** on Early-Bird discount, which is considerably cheaper than the 1200€ I'd spend on an iPhone Pro otherwise.

Which it's not to say **it doesn't come without doubts**, both for the device and for myself.

## It's all about trade-offs

The first question is if it will be powerful enough: They have stated they're using a **4nm Mediatek SOC** without specifying anything else. At the same time, they're promoting it as kind of a "second phone" device. It would make sense to be a low-end phone considering its price, but it comes with many tradeoffs. I mostly use my phone for social media, music and Carplay so the requirements are not that high, though **I wonder if it will really make the cut as a daily device**.

For sure, it is perfect for communicating (it is called the Clicks Communicator, after all) and writing overall, but as a media gal **I kinda value having a proper camera** too. It's not that I don't have a proper portable camera with my Sony ZV-1 II, but more often than not you want to have quick access to make a proper picture for unexpected moments— and it doesn't seem to be the case.

Another case would be to get it as a **temporary alternative** to play with the idea. My current iPhone 11 can take care of Carplay and the ocassional Pokémon TCGP draw, so I could carry it in the backpack as kind of a backup for quick pics while using this one more like a primary phone. Thinking about it, **it seems the most sensible choice**. I didn't have any intention of replacing it yet as it works wonders for what I use it, and this way I could even delay it even further.
