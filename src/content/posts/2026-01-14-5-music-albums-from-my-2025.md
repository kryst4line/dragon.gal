*After reading Jedda's [recap of last year's music](https://notes.jeddacp.com/2025-in-music/) and Monocyte's post with [album recommendations](https://monocyte.blog/some-music-recommendations-i-got/), I thought "and why not both?". So take this as kind of a quote and reply to both. ♡*

For the over 24k scrobbles[^1] I recorded on 2025, of course most of them are from songs or albums that have been on my library for years. I use to put it all on shuffle, but still **I want to highlight some of the albums I discovered last year**. Some weren't even released in that year— but it was when I discovered them, so in my head it still qualifies. 

Genres are (un)surprisingly varied, so I hope you can find something you like if you give them a listen.

## Twenty One Pilots — Breach (Alternative Pop, 2025)

On 2024 I got hooked on Twenty One Pilots' Clancy after never having paid much attention to them. Their huge emphasis on the **percussion, pop hooks and a surrounding production** with strong synths caught me hard and this album was not an exception— it's a direct sequel to Clancy, after all. To understand what I mean, listen to **[City Walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ozjel72yjQ)** or **[The Contract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZfH7cFp3Ys)**.

## Fox Stevenson — Sunk Cost Fallacy (Drum'n'Bass, 2025)

This guy is incredible. After having known him 15 years ago as Stan SB, he moved around genres and finally settled in a mix of **goodfeel, catchy DnB with poppy vocals**. What makes him special is a weird mix between introspective, more often than not venting lyrics (that you usually find on heavy hitting emo music) and uplifting, catchy vibes. **[Exile is a Habit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znNwAaHoWCs)** is a prime example that hit a bit too close to home, and the **[homonym song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZENXUGfGOA)** feels like the perfect way to close the album too.

## KiLLOWEN — six missed calls (UK Garage, 2025)

Nobody warned me how in 2024 I was going to get hooked on UK Garage again, and it was fault of Niko B and [an adorable bouncing Toyota Yaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SerTJpflwMM)— but this year it was my turn to discover KiLLOWEN. **[Pick your poison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnP8RwZqUUM)** would be my pick (hehe), but if I'm honest the one I heard the most comes from another album: **[Holding On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JTvMA9eVpc)**.

## Royal Coda — To Only a Few at First (Swancore, 2022)

After all the Dance Gavin Dance debacle these last years, I was in the mood for some similar groups, and then I found Royal Coda, in which there's also Will Swan himself, guitarist from DGD. And gosh, it slaps. **Kinda similar sound to DGD, but I'd say with some Emarosa touches**, which I also love. After hearing the first song, **[As We Fall Into Deep Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOEY_R3oy14)**, you'll know what I mean.

## Shirobon — Breaker (Chiptune, 2025)

I've been listening to chiptune since the late 2000s, and Shirobon is a hood classic. In this EP he made his magic on a Dirtywave M8 tracker, but keeping his classic EDM touch. As he diverged a bit to Synthwave in these last years, this **feels like a back to the roots**. If you liked Shirobon's previous works, you'll like **[Cypher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDR8VFUPdqU)**.
