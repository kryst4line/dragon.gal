What a year this has been. Almost as hard as a rollercoaster than Red Force, the only I rode when we went to Port Aventura a few months ago. No, wait a second– actually it's a pretty good comparison: you're almost all the time down at ground level except a hard upwards elevation in the middle just to go down even harder right after.

*Bwoah*, I nailed that one.

## Unemployment saga

On Christmas' Eve last year I was told I was going to be fired because the company (a small startup) wasn't going through its best days and my boss was losing a good amount of money. Honestly, it fucked me up more from the human factor than anything­­­— It was the first time I felt comfortable and calm on a workplace, and after 5 years there I developed (pun not intended) such a connection with my workmates that I only could dread at the thought of landing on yet another hellplace. All my previous experiences were plainly that: hell on Earth.

At least this time I had unemployment benefits and could spend some time working on personal projects.

## Personal projects

I think I never talked around here of Metrosky/Consolesky, my very own Bluesky clients, but that's all I've done the first half of 2025. My partner wasn't going to stop waking up on a regular schedule to work on his commissions, so do I.

I went throuygh a loooot of headaches to understand how does AT Proto work, how to work with signals (an Angular feature introduced on a later version from what I used to work with), how to structure the huge logic behind or to learn every small optimisation required to keep acceptable performance levels on an webapp this big.

And of course, it wouldn't be me if I didn't scrap everything and start again multiple times. This way is how I ended with many different revisions: one based on a mix of Metro UI and Frutiger Aero, one more standard with PrimeNg components, and another with a bit more of a Terminal/Console vibe.

It may have not been anything remarkable in the major scheme of things, but I'm pretty proud of my work in the end.

## Same shit, different year

My 32th birthday was in June, and to be painfully honest, it was awful. A reflection of my whole life: Lonely, irrelevant and unfulfilled. I remember feeling how I knew it was going to be just another day, and even though I had the smallest of hopes of a chance for a surprise, in the end there was nothing... again.

On my 30th birthday my partner tried to get a few friends from near us to have a small dinner and it turned into nothing, because one was super busy (don't blame him, he always is) and the other couple was still messing around until the same day, so we didn't even want to anymore. And this year he was also fooling around the idea of going to the go-karts with a bunch of friends— but in the end there were no friends, no go-karts and no will to live. Yay.

## Code Wars IV: A New Job

After 4-5 job interviews, in late July I finally landed on a consultancy firm with a good salary increment. At first I was a bit afraid because consultancy firms were where I had my worst working experiences, but this time it seemed different: Working remotely, in a very small team and a starting project. And it really was!

I've been there for half a year already and damn it, I can't complain. Well, I could complain, but you can complain about lots of things on any workplace— and it has been a very pleasant half a year after all. They even paid me the train tickets and hotel to attend their Christmas business dinner, which was as cool as you could expect from an express travel to Madrid.  

## Life expectations out, blogging in

A common theme all along this year has been not feeling well with myself on so many areas, so around summer I joined Bear Blog and started blogging again after... Oof, too many years— but the point is that having a relief valve to throw up all my thoughts made me feel better, so I embraced it.

So much that a few months after I was leaving aside my main social network, as it was a constant reminder of many things that aren't alright in my life. So much that I discovered the world of IndieWeb and went on to join collaborative initiatives and meet a few good people. So much that today I spent another few months afterwards coding multiple iterations of my blog until I reached [the one you're looking at](https://dragon.gal).

Maybe at some point in 2026 I'll resume posting more often on Youtube, but for now it has been fun simply to do what I felt like. Let's see what brings this new chapter.

Have a good one, pals.
