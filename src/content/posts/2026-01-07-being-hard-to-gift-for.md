I'm so bad at receiving gifts; like really, **really** bad.

Last Christmas my partner and sister teamed up to gift me something without me knowing, and that's no good. And I don't mean it in a good way, because for some reason I dread unexpected presents.

I don't have a good history with gifts, because in most cases it will be something I never asked, don't like or won't have any use for; so it will be actually a paperweight or a bulk in a drawer until I find the courage to toss it. And on top of that, then I'll feel pressured to gift something back in a rush; a situation I wasn't expecting to deal with.

I actually like gifts... or the idea of the right gift— because in very few occasions that's been a thing, and in even less they have been a surprise or had no input from my side. That's the actual reason I don't really have good vibes with being gifted.

I'm a very meticulous person that, especially for people very close to me, takes notes of what I'm told or hear randomly— and when the time comes, I know I'll be gifting something that the other person actually was looking forward to get. But year after year, the same can't be told about what people gift me, if there is any kind of gift to begin with (and maybe it's better that way).

The thing is what I got was something I was very insistent with years prior: A **Stylophone**. I was in love with that little toy, but 10 minutes after opening it I realized it was going to gather dust in a drawer... again. So obviously, I felt bad and the worst was **it was my sole fault**. At least I somehow got to play *L'Amour Toujours* by ear.
